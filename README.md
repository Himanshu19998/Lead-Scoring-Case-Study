# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Description:
This case study involves helping X Education, an online education company, improve its lead conversion rate by identifying potential leads likely to convert into paying customers. By building a logistic regression model, the goal is to assign a lead score to each lead, enabling the company to prioritize its sales efforts effectively.

Problem Statement:
X Education faces challenges with its lead conversion process despite generating numerous leads. The company wishes to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying "Hot Leads" with a higher likelihood of conversion. The task involves building a logistic regression model to assign lead scores, enabling the sales team to focus on high-potential prospects.

Insights:

Analysis of past leads revealed key factors influencing conversion rates, such as lead source, last activity, and tags associated with the lead.
Leads originating from specific sources, engaging in phone conversations, and tagged with certain labels show a higher probability of conversion.
Certain factors decrease the likelihood of conversion, such as inactive leads or leads with specific tags indicating disinterest.
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 89%, with a sensitivity of 79.6% and a specificity of 96%, indicating a well-balanced model.
Adjusting the threshold optimized precision and recall, with a threshold of 2.5 yielding a good balance between precision (92.8%) and recall (79.6%).
